        <h2>Chapter 1: Spiritual Life (Instructions 1–10)</h2>
        <p class="chapter-intro">The foundation of a godly life rests on a personal relationship with Christ, nourished through prayer, study, and corporate worship. This vertical alignment determines all horizontal conduct.</p>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h3>1. Believe in Jesus Christ <span class="verse">(John 3:16)</span></h3>
            <p class="reasoning"><strong>The Mandate:</strong> Salvation is the foundation of eternal life. All other instruction flows from this new life.</p>
            <div class="story-example">
                <p><strong>The Example (Story):</strong> The Samaritan woman at the well believed Jesus was the Christ and immediately became an evangelist, spreading the word in her city. <span class="verse">(John 4:7–29)</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-prompt">
                <p><strong>The Application:</strong> What is the primary testimony of your life since you believed? Are you actively sharing the joy of your salvation?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h3>2. Pray without ceasing <span class="verse">(1 Thessalonians 5:17)</span></h3>
            <p class="reasoning"><strong>The Mandate:</strong> Prayer is the essential act of dependence that aligns her will with God’s will.</p>
            <div class="story-example">
                <p><strong>The Example (Story):</strong> Hannah prayed so earnestly for a son that Eli thought she was drunk. Her persistence brought forth Samuel. <span class="verse">(1 Samuel 1:10–20)</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-prompt">
                <p><strong>The Application:</strong> Where have you allowed yourself to become busy instead of dependent? Write down three specific areas you need to commit to unceasing prayer this week.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h3>3. Study Scripture <span class="verse">(2 Timothy 2:15)</span></h3>
            <p class="reasoning"><strong>The Mandate:</strong> God’s Word directs her steps, guards against deception, and furnishes her for all good works.</p>
            <div class="story-example">
                <p><strong>The Example (Story):</strong> Lois & Eunice instilled the Scriptures in Timothy from a child, providing the earliest foundation for his faith and ministry. <span class="verse">(2 Timothy 1:5)</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-prompt">
                <p><strong>The Application:</strong> How much time are you intentionally setting aside to study, not just read, the Word? Is your study time leading to true spiritual direction?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h3>4. Worship in spirit and truth <span class="verse">(John 4:24)</span></h3>
            <p class="reasoning"><strong>The Mandate:</strong> God seeks sincerity; worship must come from the heart and be based on the truth of His Word, not ritual alone.</p>
            <div class="story-example">
                <p><strong>The Example (Story):</strong> Mary of Bethany poured costly spikenard oil on Jesus’ feet, demonstrating sincere, extravagant worship, valuing Him above earthly wealth. <span class="verse">(John 12:3)</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-prompt">
                <p><strong>The Application:</strong> Identify one area of your life (time, talent, or treasure) that you are holding back from extravagant, sincere worship.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h3>5. Bear fruit of the Spirit <span class="verse">(Galatians 5:22–23)</span></h3>
            <p class="reasoning"><strong>The Mandate:</strong> Fruit (love, joy, peace) is the tangible evidence of living faith and the Holy Ghost's presence.</p>
            <div class="story-example">
                <p><strong>The Example (Story):</strong> Dorcas (Tabitha) was known for her good works and charity, showing visible fruit that defined her life. <span class="verse">(Acts 9:36)</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-prompt">
                <p><strong>The Application:</strong> Which fruit (love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance) is currently weakest in your life? Pray for the Spirit's strength in that specific area.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h3>6. Train younger women <span class="verse">(Titus 2:4)</span></h3>
            <p class="reasoning"><strong>The Mandate:</strong> Older women have a spiritual duty to guide younger generations in practical and righteous living.</p>
            <div class="story-example">
                <p><strong>The Example (Story):</strong> Naomi provided guidance, protection, and wisdom to Ruth, teaching her loyalty that led to redemption. <span class="verse">(Ruth 1–3)</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="application-prompt">
                <p><strong>The Application:</strong> Who is one younger woman in your life (family, church, or work) whom you can intentionally mentor in a practical, godly skill this month?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-block">
            <h3>7. Seek wisdom <span class="verse">(Proverbs 4:7)</span></h3>
